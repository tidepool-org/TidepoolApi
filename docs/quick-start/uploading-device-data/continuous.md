## Open A New Continuous Session

If you have previously opened a continuous session, [skip ahead](#find-an-existing-continuous-session). Otherwise, issue the following command:

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "https://int-api.tidepool.org/v1/users/{userId}/data_sets",
  "query": null,
  "headers": {
    "X-Tidepool-Session-Token": "{sessionToken}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "client": {
      "name": "{clientName}",
      "version": "{clientVersion}"
    },
    "dataSetType": "continuous",
    "deduplicator": {
      "name": "org.tidepool.deduplicator.dataset.delete.origin"
    }
  }
}
```

This will return an HTTP response with a JSON body. You should store **the value of the upload session ID** to use when uploading data to this session.

```json title="Sample Response" lineNumbers=true
{
  "data": {
    "createdTime": "2019-08-29T08:05:25.851Z",
    "deduplicator": {
      "name": "org.tidepool.deduplicator.dataset.delete.origin",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "id": "{uploadSessionId}",
    "modifiedTime": "2019-08-29T08:05:25.889Z",
    "type": "upload",
    "uploadId": "{uploadSessionId}",
    "client": {
      "name": "{clientName}",
      "version": "{clientVersion}"
    },
    "dataSetType": "continuous"
  }
}
```

## Find An Existing Continuous Session

If you have previously opened a continuous session, you can use this request to get the session ID if you haven't cached it somewhere (if you already know your session ID, [skip ahead](#upload-device-data-to-the-open-session)):

```json http
{
  "method": "get",
  "url": "https://int-api.tidepool.org/v1/users/{userId}/data_sets",
  "query": {
    "client.name": "{clientName}"
  },
  "headers": {
    "X-Tidepool-Session-Token": "{sessionToken}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": null
}
```

This will return an HTTP response with a JSON body. You should temporarily store the value of the upload session ID you intend to write data to.

```json title="Sample Response" lineNumbers=true
[
  {
    "client": {
      "name": "{clientName}",
      "version": "{clientVersion}"
    },
    "createdTime": "2019-08-28T02:54:41.869Z",
    "dataSetType": "continuous",
    "deduplicator": {
      "name": "org.tidepool.deduplicator.dataset.delete.origin",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "id": "{uploadSessionId}",
    "modifiedTime": "2019-08-28T02:54:41.896Z",
    "type": "upload",
    "uploadId": "{uploadSessionId}"
  }
]
```

## Upload Device Data To The Open Session

Upload data in chunks of 1,000 records:

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "https://int-api.tidepool.org/dataservices/v1/datasets/{uploadSessionId}/data",
  "headers": {
    "X-Tidepool-Session-Token": "{sessionToken}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": [
    // array of diabetes device data objects
  ]
}
```

The body for this HTTP POST should be JSON, and follow the format outlined in the [diabetes data types](../../device-data/data-types.md) documentation.

When you upload data for a continuous session, you will also need to provide an "origin" field for every data object, that contains at least an ID, name and type. The ID is a unique identifier within your upload session that allows you to identify that data point.

As an example, uploading a couple of continuous blood glucose (CBG) records might look like this:

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "https://int-api.tidepool.org/dataservices/v1/datasets/{uploadSessionId}/data",
  "headers": {
    "X-Tidepool-Session-Token": "{sessionToken}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": [
    {
      "time": "2017-02-05T13:26:51.000Z",
      "timezoneOffset": 660,
      "clockDriftOffset": 0,
      "conversionOffset": 0,
      "deviceTime": "2017-02-06T00:26:51",
      "deviceId": "MMT-1711:12345678",
      "type": "cbg",
      "value": 119,
      "units": "mg/dL",
      "origin": {
        "id": "06b10116-e85c-4abe-8a35-4eca838bd484",
        "name": "com.apple.HealthKit",
        "type": "service"
      },
      "payload": {
        "interstitialSignal": 24.98
      }
    },
    {
      "time": "2017-02-05T13:31:51.000Z",
      "timezoneOffset": 660,
      "clockDriftOffset": 0,
      "conversionOffset": 0,
      "deviceTime": "2017-02-06T00:31:51",
      "deviceId": "MMT-1711:12345678",
      "type": "cbg",
      "value": 120,
      "units": "mg/dL",
      "origin": {
        "id": "1c26886a-ae52-4e43-84cf-5047afe3efc3",
        "name": "com.apple.HealthKit",
        "type": "service"
      },
      "payload": {
        "interstitialSignal": 25.22
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

<!-- theme: error -->

> Do not close the session after you have uploaded your data, as you would for a normal session type. If you _do_ close a continuous session, you will not be able to write to it, and will need to open a new one.
