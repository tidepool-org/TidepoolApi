# Diabetes Device Data Model

This is the data model for diabetes device types and other related data that is read and stored in Platform. All events read and stored by Platform use the [JSON](https://www.json.org/) data interchange format and have a type field identifying the subcategory of event.

In this data model, you can find definitions of the many diabetes data types from basals to pump settings. There is also documentation detailing common fields you may come across, along with other useful information ([annotations](./device-data/annotations.md), [linking events](./device-data/linking-events.md), [out of range values](./device-data/oor-values.md) and [units](./device-data/units.md)).

If you are not looking for a specific topic or information, [common fields](./device-data/common-fields.md) and [diabetes data types](./device-data/data-types.md) are a good place to start.
