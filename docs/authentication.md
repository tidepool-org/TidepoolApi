## Introduction

Tidepool uses standard [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/) or [OAuth2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for authentication and authorization flows. This provides a mechanism for 3rd party developers to securely request Tidepool to authenticate a user while ensuring privacy and confidentiality of that user's login credentials.

We also support external identity providers (IdP) for clinics that wish to utilize their own single sign-on (SSO) solution. Clinicians who log in to Tidepool are directed to their clinic's SSO login page. Upon successful login, they're redirected back to Tidepool Web.

The following references provide more detailed information on the principles and implementation of OAuth 2.0:

## Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens

Tidepool access tokens are relatively short-lived (as in, minutes). Once expired, they must be refreshed using the refresh token returned by Tidepool's authentication service.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

In the future, Tidepool will be offering the option for users to enable 2-factor authentication (2FA) to their account to further secure their account. In order to login, the user will have to present their email and password as well as a 6-digit number generated by the 2FA provider such as 1Password or Google Authenticator.
