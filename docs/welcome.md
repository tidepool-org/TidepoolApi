Welcome to Tidepool's developer documentation

This guide will be your Obi-Wan Kenobi for all things Platform (Tidepool's API platform) and will run you through the how-to's of accessing, fetching and using your Tidepool data. But who is Tidepool? What is API?

We're so glad you asked.

Tidepool is a nonprofit organization committed to providing free software for the diabetes community to get the most out of their diabetes devices.
An API, or application programming interface, is a tool that allows you to communicate with other applications, i.e. access your diabetes data by talking to your devices.

Awesome. Now that we're all caught up, [let's jump right in!](./quick-start.md)
