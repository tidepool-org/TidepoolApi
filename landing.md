# Introduction

Tidepool is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. We were founded by people with diabetes, caregivers, and leading healthcare providers committed to helping all people with insulin-requiring diabetes safely achieve great outcomes through more accessible, actionable, and meaningful diabetes data.

We are committed to empowering the next generation of innovations in diabetes management. We harness the power of technology to provide intuitive software products that help people with diabetes.

# API Documentation

We strongly believe in transparency and all of our products are open source with either [BSD-2](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause.html) or [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) license. To that end, this site hosts two views of the Tidepool API:

* [(Public) API](https://tidepool.stoplight.io/docs/tidepool-api) shows the Tidepool APIs that are available to everyone. These are the APIs used by Tidepool's own customer-facing products.
* [Full API](https://tidepool.stoplight.io/docs/tidepool-full-api) shows all of Tidepool's APIs. This includes APIs that are only available between services within our AWS VPC, or require privileged access levels, or simply are not really useful for anyone outside of Tidepool. They are included here both for internal reference, but also because anyone with the time and energy can see them in our open-source software.

# Deprecation Warning: Authentication APIs

Tidepool is deprecating the current authentication APIs that may expose user's username and password credentials to 3rd party developers. These APIs are replaced by industry-standard [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) and [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) authentication APIs. This enables Tidepool to provide a consistent and secure sign-up and sign-in user experience for all applications, including offering [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) or enterprise [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://tidepool.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUBSEC/pages/1931378716/Single+Sign+On+Federated+Authentication+and+Authorization) via external identity providers (IdP) such as [Okta](https://www.okta.com/), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [Microsoft ADFS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/active-directory-federation-services), and so on.

We expect to fully remove the current authentication APIs by the end of 2023.

# Environments

If you plan to develop software that uses Tidepool APIs, please send us an [email](mailto:info@tidepool.org) or join our [public #opensource Slack Channel](http://public-chat.tidepool.org). You will need to request a client identifier for your application in order to use the new authentication APIs. Make sure we know who you are so that we can keep you updated on our progress and any other upcoming API changes!

## Development (`dev`, `qa1`, `qa2`)

The development environments are for Tidepool's internal development use only. **Do not use them at all**, as they are in constant state of change and testing. There are no guarantees for privacy or stability of accounts or data.

## Integration (`int`)

The integration environment is for development proof-of-concept tests only. **Do not use it for production data**. There are no guarantees for privacy or stability of accounts or data.

To use the integration environment, you will need to create accounts on the integration environment and upload data via the integration environment. For example, before logging into the Tidepool Uploader, right click and set server to “integration”.

Once you have tested your software on the integration environment, let us know so we can review plans with you to move to our production environment.

## Production (`prd`)

Please do not use our production environment during your development. Only use the integration environment, or your own [local back-end server environment](https://github.com/tidepool-org/development).
