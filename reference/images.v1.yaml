      List, create, and manage images.

      Images may be created with or without metadata and content.
      The content format may be either JPEG or PNG, with or without transparency.
      The content width and height may be up to 10,000 pixels.
      The content size, in bytes, may be up to 100MB.
      Each image has a `status`.
      If an image is created without content, then its status is `created`.
      If the image is created with content or has been updated to include content then its status is `available`.
      Each image with content has a `contentIntent`.
      When content is uploaded for an image, the uploader must specify whether the intent of the content is `original`,
        indicating that the content is the original, or `alternate`, indicating that the content is an alternate version
        of the original, typically a smaller, lower resolution or lower quality version.
      The image may be created or updated with `alternate` content intent initially and at a later time updated with the `original` content intent.
      This supports mobile device clients initially uploading low resolution `alternate` content while on a cellular network and later uploading the `original` content while on a WiFi network.
      When content is uploaded or downloaded, the MD5 digest of the content may be included to confirm the correct bytes were received.
      Renditions of the current content can be requested using a variety of URL path parameters.
      The requested rendition can specify the width, height, mode of transformation, background color, quality (JPEG only), and format.
      See the Get Image Rendition endpoint for further details.

      description: >-
        List images for the specified user after applying all of the specified filters.

        The `status` query parameter may be specified to filter the response to only those images with the specified `status`.
        The `status` query parameter may be set to one of:
          - `available` - return those images with content (i.e. images where renditions can be generated)
          - `created` - return those images without content

        If the `status` query parameter is not specified then the default behavior is to filter on `available` status.
        This query parameter may be specified *multiple* times.

        The `contentIntent` query parameter may be specified to filter the response to only those images with content with the specified `contentIntent`.
        The `contentIntent` query parameter may be set to one of:
          - `alternate` - return those images with alternate content; alternate content is typically a smaller, lower resolution or lower quality version of the original content
          - `original` - return those images with original content

        If the `contentIntent` query parameter is not specified then the default behavior is to not filter based upon content intent.
        This query parameter may be specified *multiple* times.
        The `page` and `size` query parameters may be specified to paginate the response.

        For example:
          - `GET /v1/users/a43d25a01f/images`
          - `GET /v1/users/a43d25a01f/images?page=4&size=50`
          - `GET /v1/users/a43d25a01f/images?status=available&status=created`
          - `GET /v1/users/a43d25a01f/images?contentIntent=original`
          - `GET /v1/users/a43d25a01f/images?status=created&contentIntent=alternate&page=2&size=250`

            The status of the images to be returned.
            The status of an image is initially `created` and becomes `available` when content is successfully uploaded.
            If not specified, only images with `available` status are returned.
            May be specified *multiple* times.

          description: >-
            The content intent of the images to be returned.
            An image can not have content, have `alternate` content, or have `original` content.
            If not specified, no filtering based upon content intent is applied.
            May be specified *multiple* times.

        The update is not a wholesale replace of the entire metadata.
        Each field within the metadata update replaces each field in the existing image metadata.
        The `revision` query parameter may be specified to require that the current image *must* have the specified revision in order to apply the update.
        If the specified `revision` does not match the actual revision of the image, then a `404` error is returned.
        If used properly this can prevent accidental overwrite by multiple simultaneous updates or deletes.

      summary: Get Image Content (Suffix)
      description: >-
        Get the content for specified image with an optional suffix.

        The suffix may be any additional path segments after the required portion.
        The only restriction is that if the last path segment specifies an extension (ie. contains a dot) then the extension
        must match the format of the image content.
        If it does not then a `404` error is returned.

        The suffix may be specified to enable sane browser downloads.
        An example provides the clearest explanation.
        If the `imageId` were `ac0fd9cfbc4a3d25a01fb8c390d7523b` and it contained JPEG content then these would all be valid URLs:

        - `/v1/images/ac0fd9cfbc4a3d25a01fb8c390d7523b/content`

        If the image does not already have content, then any content intent is allowed on update.
        If the image already has content with `alternate` content intent, then only `original` content intent is allowed on update.
        If the image already has content with `original` content intent, then any request to update the content results in a `400` error being returned.

      summary: Get Image Rendition
      description: >-
        Get a rendition of the image content.

        The `rendition` parameter is a sequence of key-value pairs separated by an underscore
        followed by a filename `extension` parameter representing the format of the requested rendition.
        These parameters are used to calculate the necessary transformations to apply to the image content before returning.

        The valid rendition parameters are:
          - `w` - width - the value is an integer width of the requested rendition; if the width is not
          specified then it is calculated using the height parameter and the aspect ratio of the image content
          - `h` - height - the value is an integer height of the requested rendition; if the height is not
          specified then it is calculated using the width parameter and the aspect ratio of the image content
          - `m` - mode - the value is the mode used to transform the image content into the requested
            rendition; the default mode is `fit`; the valid modes are:
              - `fill` - return an image with the exact specified or calculated width and height while retaining
                the aspect ratio of the image content; use only the part of the image content that fills the
                specified dimensions, if necessary; only part of the image content might be visible if the requested
                aspect ratio is different from the image content aspect ratio
              - `fillDown` - same as `fill`, but only if requested rendition is smaller than image content;
                otherwise, return the image content as-is
              - `fit` - the image content is resized so that it takes up as much space as possible within a
                bounding box defined by the specified or calculated width and height; the aspect ratio is
                respected and all of the image content is visible
              - `fitDown` - same as `fit`, but only if requested rendition is smaller than image content;
                otherwise, return the image content as-is
              - `pad` - resize the image to fill the specified or calculated width and height while retaining the
                aspect ratio; if the proportions of the image content do not match the specified
                or calculated width and height, padding using the background color is added to the image to match
                the specified size
              - `padDown` - same as `pad`, but only if requested rendition is smaller than image content;
                otherwise, return the image content as-is
              - `scale` - change the size of the image content exactly to match the specified width and height; may
                not respect the image content aspect ratio; all image content parts are visible, but
                might be squeezed or stretched
              - `scaleDown` - same as `scale`, but only if requested rendition is smaller than image content;
                otherwise, return the image content as-is
          - `b` - background - the value is a string representing a 3-byte RGB or 4-byte RGBA value
            for the background color; used if the transformed image content does not perfectly match the requested
            rendition size or the image content is a transparent PNG and the requested rendition is a JPEG; for example: `aaccaa`,
            `aaccaaff`; the alpha channel is used only when the requested renditon is a PNG; the default background is `ffffffff`
          - `q` - quality - the value is an integer from 1 to 100 representing the quality of the requested rendition;
            the default quality is 95; ignored if the requested format is not JPEG

        The key and value of each rendition parameter are separated by a `=` and each of those are separated by a `_`.
        Only one of the width or height rendition parameters are required.
        All other rendition parameters are optional.
        The order of the parameters is irrelevant.
        The rendition extension does *not* have to match the image content MIME type.
        Any necessary conversion between image formats will be made.
        This API is intended to generate a *small, single-digit* number of different renditions for each image.
        Please do not use this API to generate large numbers of different renditions.

      summary: Get Image Rendition (Suffix)
      description: >-
        Get a rendition of the image content with an optional suffix.

        Same as Get Image Rendition with the addition of allowing for an optional suffix between
        the rendition parameters and rendition extension.
        The suffix may be any sequence of additional path segments.
        The suffix may be specified to enable sane browser downloads.

        For example:
