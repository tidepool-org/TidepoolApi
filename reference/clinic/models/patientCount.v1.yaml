      The count of patients associated with the clinic that are classified as demo and do not 
      apply towards the plan-based patient count limit. Currently this is limited to 0 or 1,

    description: |-
      The count of patients associated with the clinic classified as applying towards the 
      plan-based patient count limit. This excludes patients classified as demo as well as any 
      other classifications that do not apply towards the plan-based patient count limit 
      for various business reasons.

    minimum: 0
  providers:
    type: object
    description: |-
      The count of patients associated with the clinic by provider. As each patient may be associated 
      with multiple providers, the sum of all provider counts may exceed the total patient count.
