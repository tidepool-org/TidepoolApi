title: Target Devices
description: |
  When uploading data, the user selects a target device (typically
  make and model) of their data source (i.e. meter or pump) from a
  list. This selection is used by the Tidepool Uploader to select the
  correct drivers for communicating with the data source.

  These values are stored in the user's profile so that they can be
  pre-selected on next use, thereby streamlining the process.
